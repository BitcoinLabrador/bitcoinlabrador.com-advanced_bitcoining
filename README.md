## bitcoinlabrador.com - Advanced Bitcoining
The beginner's guide is made to get people from precoiner into newcoiner territory. But I feel like the bitcoin space also lacks a good, easy to understand and condensed 'second step'. The Advanced Bitcoining section will try to explain complicated topics in an accessible way. Some early ideas:

# 1. Your own full node
Why do you want to run your own full node? What can you do with a node (incl 3rd party apps like electrum, BTCpay and dojo). How do you do it? What are the different node options and what are the advantages / disadvantages of each? 

# 2. Hardware wallets
The beginner's guide will probably introduce people to mobile wallets - they're the most user-friendly way to store your bitcoins. This part will explain why a mobile wallet isn't a good idea for larger amounts of bitcoin and will introduce hardware wallets. I'll also go into when you would consider a hardware wallet.

# 3. Multisig
Expanding on the hardware wallet story, I'll also go into multisig, what it is, why you should want it and how you can achieve it.

# 4. Bitcoin Privacy  
(Re)claiming your privacy on the blockchain can be hard, and there are quite a few twitter threads that go into the virtues of the different options. Mainly wasabi vs samourai is a hot topic. I'll go into samourai and wasabi, as well as joinmarket, and list the things you absolutely should and shouldn't do to avoid fucking up your coinjoins.

# 5. Whatever else I can come up with
